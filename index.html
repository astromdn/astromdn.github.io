<h1>About the Multimessenger Diversity Network</h1>
<p>The Multimessenger Diversity Network (MDN) is a community of representatives from multimessenger astronomy research collaborations focused on increasing diversity in the field. The MDN shares knowledge, experiences, and training and develops resources and practices around broadening participation. The MDN provides structure through organizational principles and tools; opportunity to go beyond individual accomplishments; legitimacy in broadening participation efforts; presence at conferences, on websites and media outlets; training for members of the network; support from each other and for current, and future, STEM professionals.</p>
